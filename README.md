## Motivation

The purpose of this mini-app is to demonstrate my abilities as an mobile app developer/engineer. This was one of my very first apps. 

Areas of focus: <strong> MapKit/CLGeocoder, API/RESTful Services, Udacity Authentication, FBSDKLoginKit </strong>

Architecture: <strong> Model-View-Controller (MVC) </strong>

## Features

- [x] Persisting Data of Student Locations via Pins
- [x] Authentications via Facebook and Udacity
- [x] URL Requests

## Requirements

• iOS 12.0+ < 14.0

• XCode 11+

## Swift Package Dependencies

• Facebook 7.0.0

## API Reference

## Privacy

Students do not upload their own names on the pins. Random public usernames are added to the student's pin for privacy purpose.
