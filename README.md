# OnTheMap

On the Map is a simple app that allows Udacity Students to add their location on a map. 

## Purpose

Udacity Online assigns this project in order for students to learn how to make requests via an `API` and using the `RESTful service`. 

## Privacy

Students will not have their own names on the pins. Random public usernames are added to the student's pin for privacy purpose.
